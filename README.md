These builds were made during my college Computer Organization (CSC 205) class. At the time, I was running on a Chromebook and no Pep/9 builds were available for Linux. Spent some time learning how to build from source managed to produce the only Linux build of Pep/9 available at the time. The Pep/9 simulator can be found [here](http://computersystemsbook.com/5th-edition/pep9/) as well as the offical Linux build.
